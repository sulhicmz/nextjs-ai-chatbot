# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Chat Bot Not Responding with "No Internet" Error

If your chat bot is deployed on Vercel and showing a "no internet" error despite having a working internet connection, this guide will help you diagnose and fix the issue.

## Common Causes on Vercel

1. **Environment Variables Not Properly Set**
2. **AI Gateway Integration Issues**
3. **Database Connection Problems**
4. **Authentication Configuration Issues**

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Navigate to your Vercel project settings:
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click on "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
3. Verify that all required variables are set:
   - `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
   - `POSTGRES_URL`
   - `AUTH_SECRET`
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

### 2. Use the Debug Endpoint

Visit your deployed application at `/debug` to check the environment status:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/debug
```

This will show you which environment variables are properly set.

### 3. Check Vercel Logs

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Logs" in the sidebar
3. Look for error messages when trying to send a message
4. Pay attention to:
   - Database connection errors
   - AI Gateway authentication errors
   - Missing environment variable warnings

### 4. Verify AI Gateway Configuration

1. Ensure your `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is correctly set
2. Check that your Vercel project has access to the AI Gateway
3. Verify your API key hasn't expired or been revoked

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Environment Variables

If any environment variables are missing:
1. Add them in your Vercel project settings
2. Redeploy your application
3. Wait for the deployment to complete

### Solution 2: Database Connection

If there are database connection issues:
1. Verify your `POSTGRES_URL` format is correct
2. Ensure your database is accessible from Vercel

If there are AI Gateway issues:
1. Verify your `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is valid
2. Check that your Vercel project is properly integrated with AI Gateway

## Testing Your Fix

After making changes:
1. Redeploy your application
2. Visit `/debug` to verify environment variables
